# Restaurant Reviews
Restaurant reviews is a project include in Udacity's Mobile Web Specialist Nanodegree program. It is a 3 stage project. 

## Stage One
I will have take a static design that lacks accessibility and convert the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. I will also begin converting this to a Progressive Web Application by caching some assets for offline use.

Since I am working on stage one, So i am not including any of forthcoming stages. I will definitely include it once i will completed this stage one successfully.

## Specification
I have been provided code for a restaurant reviews website. The code has a lot of issues. It’s barely usable on a desktop browser, much less a mobile device. It also doesn’t include any standard accessibility features, and it doesn’t work offline at all. It is my job is to update the code to resolve these issues while still maintaining the included functionality.
